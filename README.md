# React Simon Says

![React Simon Says](./screenshot.png)

So bassicaly I needed a reason to play with the awesome [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) from [@mxstbr](http://twitter.com/mxstbr) and
then I decided to build a "Simon Says" like game 

You can play it [here](https://weslleyaraujo.github.io/react-simon-says/)

## Summary

The app was build with [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) so it was quite simple to manage the dataflow using [`async`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) functions
together with [Redux Thunk middleware](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
