# Stuff that needs to be done

## Must
 - Instead of presentation use "play/sing" or something related
 - Rename blocks to "pad"
 - Write tests (@mauriciosoares will do all of it!!!!)
 - Add github pages package
 - Write a nice readme
 - Delete this file and its whole git history
 - Make it public
 - Deploy
 - Share

## Ideas

- Make title use `neon` helper, create a "smart" component with local state which from time to time will add a neon for each letter in a text
creating a "domino" effect
